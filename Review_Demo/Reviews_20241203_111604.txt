Review: body: though earphones can be bought for ₹100 as well but the quality of these BOAT ones is incredibly unmatchable.. it has been almost a week since I'm using them and I'm totally satisfied with the bass, value for money & comfort they provide.moreover the packaging is woah! loving the fact that they come with 2 extra pairs of budsjust a little suggestion— the mic should have been more distant from the plugs, the rest of the features are just wow.

Review: In a word, it's good Earphone. but is not a very very good Earphone, it's value for money. My rating is 7.5 out of 10. Bass is medium, it's not very high and it's not very low Bass. You can enjoy music with moderate bass. Personaly I recommend who are bass lover, they should not buy it. Sound quality is good, clear, but it's not very very good and clear, but it's clear. it is litewaite and  comfortable in Ear for long time. So, if you are Bass lover, you don't go. but if you need mideum bass, clear sound, yes you must buy it, and enjoy music with bass.  One think, i can not get any serial number, from package and warranty card both sides. So i can't Warranty registration. And i wanted contacted to BoAt customer service or etc.

Review: This earphone is really excellent. I bought from this business for the first time and I must tell it's of very high quality...the sound is excellent and flawless; it cancels all background noises and is also great for music and lectures...It has a type C plug, which is great because typical earphones wear out and become damaged at the plug site, thus I really enjoyed it. Also, the style of the earbuds is quite distinctive and fits wonderfully in the ear. My favorite buy so far.

They offer great value compared to many other brands in the market.Cons:1. Limited Noise Isolation: While the earphones provide decent passive noise isolation, they may not completely block out external sounds in noisy environments. Users seeking a more immersive experience might want to consider noise-canceling options.2. Cable Durability: Although the cable is tangle-free, it might be prone to wear and tear with heavy usage. Care should be taken to avoid pulling or bending it excessively.3. Sound Signature: The bass-heavy sound signature may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those who prefer a more balanced sound profile. It might overpower mids and highs in certain music genres.4. No Inline Controls: While the microphone is handy for calls, there are no inline controls for volume or playback, which can be inconvenient for some users.Overall:The boAt Bassheads 100 in Ear Wired Earphones (Furious Red) are an excellent choice for anyone seeking quality sound and comfort at an affordable price.

Review: the sound quality is a bit muddy, especially at lower volumes, but for a dozen dollars, you cant really beat it. really durable too, lasted four months and could've lasted a few more if it weren't for the cruel, steely hatred of wires my pets have
