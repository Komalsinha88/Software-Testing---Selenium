    The bag is super sturdy btw I got brown one and the quality of the material is quite sturdy and strong. Strap is also good and enough spacious as well for go to bag category . Just you cannot expect to put much things in it . The colour is also good and being a sling bag it's quite versatile .Leather quality is good in my opinion and the weight is also upto the mark (not so heavy or light).
